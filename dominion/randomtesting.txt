Assignment 3
Yipeng Song

I create three random tests for adventurer, great_hall and Smithy.
Test report is shown as following:

Test for adventurer:
  Lines executed:100.00% of 18
  Branches executed:100.00% of 12
  Taken at least once:100.00% of 12
  Calls executed:100.00% of 3

Test for Great_hall:
  Lines executed:100.00% of 6
  No branches
  Calls executed:100.00% of 3

The Smithy card is a case in the function cardEffect, so here is the coverage
before and after testing Smithy:

Before:
Function 'cardEffect'
Lines executed:6.10% of 164
Branches executed:16.79% of 137
Taken at least once:2.19% of 137
Calls executed:4.08% of 49

After:
Function 'cardEffect'
Lines executed:8.54% of 164
Branches executed:18.25% of 137
Taken at least once:4.38% of 137
Calls executed:8.16% of 49


The total coverage for after three test is :
File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:29.33% of 566
Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

Comparing with the coverage after unittesting,
Test Report:(after running all 8 tests):
  File 'dominion.c'
  Lines executed:33.92% of 566

the number is very close. I think it's because last time I ran 8 test but this time
I ran only 3 tests, and the branch executed is 100% for those three tests. Therefore,
the random test is much more powerful than the unit test.
