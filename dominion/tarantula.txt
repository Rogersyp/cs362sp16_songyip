I wrote the tarantula application in Python because Python was very easy for me
to use string parsing. Getopt and shelve libraries were used becaused I feel
comfortable with them.

Shelve helps to record the gcov information and picks the top 10 most suspicious
lines within that gcov.

I spent some time in this project trying to find the problems within this code 
as I found it quite difficult to debug. I chose the tarantula program as it 
seemed like the most user friendly to use and easiest to read.

I used this tarantula program to find some faults in a variety of functions in
dominion including the smithyEffect function and the scoreFor function.
While I had found faults in these functions tarantula couldn't tell me much more
than that. So while it is very useful in finding functions with faults I would
say it isn't that great with finding the underlaying reason. With that being
said it is very effective in narrowing down the possibilities quickly.
