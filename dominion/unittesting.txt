Test Report:(after running all 8 tests):
  File 'dominion.c'
  Lines executed:33.92% of 566

Testing Effort:
  Unfortunately, no bugs is found in these 8 unit test cases.
  However, 34% of code coverage is not too bad considering I am only running 8 unit tests
  We need more tests to find the bug(s), and random testing is probably a better way!
