Debugging

I was going through my dominion code to try and find a bug within my code. I noticed
that in my adventurer card function, in the second while loop, I am checking if z-1 >= 1, 
which means if the temp card is 1, it will break the loop and not discard the cards in play 
that have been drawn. To fix this, the condition should be z-1 >= 0. Line 674



Agan's Principles that were used:

	-Understand the system: It is imperative to know how the game is played in order to
	debug, because you need to know how each function should pay in the game.
	
	-Make It fail: I was able to use assert statements to make sure the game was 
	being played correctly when a random tester was run.
	
	-Change one thing at a time: At the beginning, I was confusing myself becuase I was trying
	to change code in multiple files at the same time. This would cause more errors in the 
	long run and more time to fix the errors that were being made.
